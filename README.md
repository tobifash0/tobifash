# Welcome to my Github, I'm Tobi!
I am an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst with a strong WordPress design and development foundation, having worked as a freelance WordPress designer for over 7 years. Throughout my career, I’ve built and optimized websites using WordPress for numerous clients, helping businesses establish a secure and scalable online presence. Now, I’m transitioning into cybersecurity to protect digital systems and assets from growing threats.

With my background in web development, I have a deep understanding of website vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and user data protection. I am expanding my expertise by gaining certifications and skills in cybersecurity, including threat analysis, risk management, and incident response.
